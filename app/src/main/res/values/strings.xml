        <item>Acetazolamide works by blocking the action of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase.
            Blocking this enzyme reduces the amount of fluid (called aqueous humour) that you make in the front part of your eye,
            and this helps to lower the pressure within your eye.

            Acetazolamide is sometimes prescribed for other conditions which are not covered by this leaflet.
            If you have been prescribed it to remove excess water from your body, to prevent altitude sickness or to help treat epilepsy,

        <item>Brinzolamide works by blocking the action of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase.
            Blocking this enzyme reduces the amount of fluid that you make in the front part of your eye (called aqueous humour),
            and this helps to lower the pressure within your eye.

            Sometimes, more than one type of eye drop is needed to keep the pressure in the eye low.
            If this is the case for you, you may be asked to use two different eye drops, or you may be given drops which combine more than one type.
            Brinzolamide is available as a combination eye drop with a beta-blocker called timolol (in a brand called AzargaÂ®), and with a medicine called brimonidine (in a brand called SimbrinzaÂ®).</item>

            Only one eye may be infected to begin with, but it often spreads to both eyes. Most cases of infective conjunctivitis clear within a week or so without treatment.
            For more severe infections, or for infections which do not clear on their own, an antibiotic eye drop such as ciprofloxacin is used./n

            Ciprofloxacin is also prescribed to treat corneal ulcers. A corneal ulcer is one which forms on the delicate layer covering the surface of your eye.</item>
        <item>Dexamethasone eye drops are used to treat short-term inflammatory eye conditions. They are usually prescribed by an eye specialist. They contain a corticosteroid (sometimes called a steroid) which helps relieve inflammation, redness and irritation.\n

        <item>Hay fever is caused by an allergy to pollen. The symptoms of hay fever are due to your immune system reacting to pollen.
            Cells on the lining of your eyes release a chemical called histamine, which causes conjunctivitis (eye inflammation).
            Hay fever is also called seasonal allergic conjunctivitis because symptoms tend to occur at the same time, or in the same season, each year.
            Typical symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis are red, itchy and watery eyes.
            Emedastine drops relieve these symptoms by blocking the action of histamine in the cells on the surface of your eyes.</item>

Only one eye may be infected to begin with, but it often spreads to both eyes. Most cases of infective conjunctivitis clear within a week or so without treatment. For more severe infections, or for infections which do not clear on their own, an antibiotic eye drop such as gentamicin is used.\n

Gentamicin eye drops are also prescribed for minor eye injuries, such as scratches and abrasions to the cornea - the delicate layer covering the surface of your eye. In such cases, the drops are prescribed to prevent an eye infection from developing while the eye heals.</item>
        <item>Homatropine makes the pupil of your eye larger and relaxes the muscles in your eye. These things make it easier for your eye to be examined and your vision tested.\n

Homatropine drops can also be prescribed during the treatment of a condition called anterior uveitis. This is a painful eye condition caused by inflammation within the eye. By making your pupil larger and relaxing the muscles in your eye, it reduces pain and allows the inflamed part of your eye to rest and recover.</item>
        <item>Hypromellose eye drops are also known as artificial tears. They are used to relieve eye dryness and soreness, particularly where the dryness is caused by a reduced flow of tears. They moisten, soothe and lubricate the surface of your eye, making it feel more comfortable.\n

            Although infective conjunctivitis may clear without treatment, antibiotic eye drops such as moxifloxacin can often be helpful.</item>
        <item>Nepafenac eye drops relieve eye pain and swelling which can be caused by cataract surgery.
            They are also used to reduce the risk of this occurring in people who are at particular risk of it.
            Nepafenac belongs to a group of medicines known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</item>
        <item>Ofloxacin eye drops are used to treat bacterial eye infections. They work by helping to kill the bacteria which are causing the infection.\n

Eye infections are a common cause of conjunctivitis. In conjunctivitis, your eye becomes inflamed, feels gritty, and may water more than usual.
            The white of your eye may look red, and your eyelids may become swollen and stuck together with a discharge when you wake up in the morning.
            Only one eye may be infected to begin with, but it often spreads to both eyes. Most cases of infective conjunctivitis clear within a week or so without treatment.\n
            For more severe infections, or for infections which do not clear on their own, an antibiotic eye drop such as ofloxacin can be used.</item>
        <item>Pilocarpine eye drops are used for glaucoma. They are most commonly used for acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG).
            This occurs when the pressure inside your eye gets too high very quickly. AACG is sometimes referred to as acute closed-angle glaucoma, or simply, acute glaucoma.
            It must be treated straightaway.\n

This type of glaucoma is caused by a sudden blockage in your eye, which prevents fluid from draining out of your eye.
            As more fluid is still being made in your eye, the pressure inside your eye starts to rise quickly.
            This causes pain and redness and your vision may be affected. Pilocarpine works by causing your pupil to constrict which opens up the drainage channels in your eye.
            This allows the fluid to leave your eye and relieves the pressure.\n

There are other types of glaucoma which occur more gradually but pilocarpine is not commonly used for the treatment of these.</item>
        <item>Sodium cromoglicate eye drops relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis by reducing the release of a chemical called histamine which causes inflammation.
            They are suitable for use in adults and children. The drops are available on prescription, and you can also buy them at a pharmacy and other retail outlets, without a prescription.\n

Sodium cromoglicate is also available as a nasal spray, inhaler and oral capsules. See the individual medicine leaflets for more information on these products.</item>
        <item>Travoprost eye drops work by increasing the drainage of fluid from inside your eye. This helps to lower the pressure within your eye.

Sometimes, more than one type of eye drop is needed to keep the pressure in the eye low. If this is the case for you, you may be asked to use two different eye drops, or you may be given drops which combine more than one type.
            Travoprost is available as a combination eye drop with another medicine which reduces eye pressure, called timolol (a beta-blocker), in a brand called DuoTravÂ®.</item>
